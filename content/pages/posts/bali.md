### Somewhere in Ubud



### Surfing Mecca, the jungle, $4 pizza at Garden Canggu, $2 nasi goreng, and $1 coffee! What's not to like! 

###

It's a fusion of nature and the modern world. I enjoy the presence of the jungle and its assiduous growth, admiring the majesty of the volcanic Mountains in the background, and all the pretty variations of beaches here! From Maldives-esque fine sand, to new black volcanic sand..
